## Agile Development
---
#### During the development of the BlackFriday Market website, I implemented an Agile methodology and I applied MoSCoW Prioritization to effectively classify tasks based on their importance and urgency. Asutilised a Kanban board on GitHub linked to my repository. 


## MoSCoW Prioritization

* **Must Have**
* **Should Have**
* **Could Have**
* **Won't Have**

## Kanban Board Overview
---

* **To do:** This column contains user stories that are ready for development.
* **In Progress:** This column tracks user stories currently being worked on.
* **Done:** This column holds all the tasks that have been successfully completed.

## HTML
***

* I used the  [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) HTML Validator to check the HTML on each of my site pages by Direct Input. I have resolved the necessary errors (extra tags and correcting how width is set in an img tag). However there are some error messages remaning which are due to the content being created using Django Summernote editor in the admin panel.
